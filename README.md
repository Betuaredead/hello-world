# Hello, World!

This is an introductory example repository as per [tutorialization](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) on the documentation pages.

Unfortunately, **reviewing open pull requests** from collaborators is not covered in this tutorial.

> ### Reviewing a pull request
>
> When you start collaborating with others, this is the time you'd ask for their review. This allows your collaborators to comment on, or propose changes to, your pull request before you merge the changes into the `main` branch.
> 
> We won't cover reviewing pull requests in this tutorial, but if you're interested in learning more, see "About pull request reviews." Alternatively, try the GitHub Skills "Reviewing pull requests" course.
